# CSS Rockets
This is a revamp of my [CSS Drawings](https://gitlab.com/Yappydog/css-drawings) project on GitLab.

This is a simple animation of the SpaceX Falcon9 Stage Seperation.

This is currently a WIP and I plan to add more animations.

You can see the animation in action [here](https://cssrockets.netlify.com/).
